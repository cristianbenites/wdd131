            <h2>Alma 38:10-12</h2>
            <p>
                And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I
                would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.
                See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your
                much strength.
                Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled
                with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.

            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
